# Ethical-Hacking-and-RSA-cracking-System
In this I have uploaded the walkthrough of two machines that I hacked during course in Ethical Hacking.
The tools and concepts that were used attack the machines were Nmap, Dirb, Privilege Escalation, Exploits, Metasploit, Burp Suite,
Injections (SQL and Command), Path traversal issues, Local and remote file inclusion, Cross-site scripting: reflected and stored, XXE: web shells,
Hash Extraction (John, Hashcat), JSON Web token (JWT) Manipulation, Type juggling attacks, Magic Hashes, Hash extraction.
Also during the course I had developed code of cracking RSA public key and private key to find p and q by using Weiner attack and Pollard p-1 attack.
